Additionally, pointer operations involved in dynamic data structures can be complex and lead to errors such as memory leaks. Static data structures, like arrays, have fixed sizes and allocate memory at compile time, which can lead to faster access times due to contiguous memory allocation and no overhead from dynamic memory management.

                "feedback": "Correct, tuber cells in potatoes are storage cells that typically lack chloroplasts. They are designed for storing starch rather than for photosynthesis. You've identified an appropriate cell type that reflects understanding of plant cell specialization."

                "feedback": "This answer is not correct. Leaf cells typically contain chloroplasts because they are involved in photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy in plants. In potato plants, it's the tuber cells that lack chloroplasts, as they are primarily for storage."
